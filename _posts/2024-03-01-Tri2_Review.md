Our project offers a comprehensive travel planning solution designed specifically for individuals keen on exploring San Diego. Our platform boasts a variety of tools to help users tailor their ideal trip. One standout feature is our dynamic weather page, which harnesses an API to deliver up-to-the-minute weather updates for San Diego. This enables users to adjust their plans based on current weather conditions. Additionally, our interactive map page provides users with a detailed overview of San Diego, simplifying exploration of its neighborhoods, landmarks, and points of interest. For those in search of exciting experiences, our activities page serves as a curated guide to the city's top attractions and events, encompassing everything from iconic landmarks to hidden gems. To streamline the planning process, we offer a customizable itinerary feature, allowing users to efficiently organize their schedule and input preferences to create a personalized San Diego adventure plan. With these intuitive features, our platform empowers travelers to maximize their San Diego experience, ensuring lasting memories and fulfillment.

# My Feature
I created two features: a weather tool and a time tracker. The weather tool displays the current conditions (temperature and a corresponding image like a sun or cloud) by using an api. The time tracker allows users to input their activity from the day and the tool will display a pie chart depicting how much of the day they have used up and how many hours remain.
