Every github project should have a readme
Every github pages project should have an index.md
Index.md is the first page that you land on when you enter the website
Md stands for markdown
Index.md gets translated to index.html
And the process is called generating an id
Make means to construct, build, or to form
Make is changing to index.html
You can author a file that looks like html
And if it is a markdown than it converts to html
Notebooks
Ipy.nb
Interactive python notebook
Md convert changes form to notebook
Post directory is a apart of github pages
Ipy files wont work. They should be in the md section
Ipy is the source and md is the destination
gitignore will make sure that generated files aren’t published to github
I will have PAIN in my life if I publish my generated files
Only commit files that I make
.pyc = python cash 
Yaml - yet another markdown language
