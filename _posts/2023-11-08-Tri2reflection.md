This trimester I learned about the way I work, and how I struggle to manage my time. In the beginning of the trimester, I worked extremely hard, but there came a point in the trimester in the middle where I realized that I had too much on my plate. So, I decided to remove a few activities in order to commit more time to CSP. I had the ability to commit more of my changes and work. 

I worked most on front-end this trimester, being responsible for our Passion Project's quizzes. I tried to help with the endpoints in backend, but it didn't make it in the final code. I also had many merge errors, which led to a lot of my code being left on my personal page. 

Team Teaching
- In our team teaching which was about Algorithms, I created 2 popcorn hacks and discussed Robot MCQ problems, and palindromes.
- I got the opportunity to share the knowledge I gained
 
# Future Plans

Personally, I had a difficult time with working on my Chromebook and I hope to use a more accessible computer in the future. 
As I reflect on the experiences of the first trimester, I've identified a strategic direction for my learning journey in the upcoming term. One key aspect I am keen on addressing is the distribution of my focus between frontend and backend development.

While I devoted a significant amount of energy to honing my frontend skills in the past trimester, I recognize the need to achieve a more balanced proficiency in both frontend and backend technologies. Therefore, my primary goal for the next trimester is to shift a considerable portion of my learning efforts towards the backend.

This intentional pivot towards backend development is driven by a desire to foster a more comprehensive understanding of the entire web development stack. I acknowledge that a well-rounded developer possesses the ability to seamlessly integrate both frontend and backend components, creating robust and efficient web applications. To achieve this, I plan to engage in targeted learning resources, such as online courses, tutorials, and hands-on projects that specifically focus on backend technologies, frameworks, and server-side scripting languages.

Simultaneously, I am committed to brushing up on my frontend skills. Recognizing the dynamic nature of frontend technologies and design principles, I aim to stay updated with the latest advancements and industry best practices. This involves revisiting key frontend concepts, exploring new frameworks or libraries, and staying attuned to emerging trends that influence user interface and user experience design.

By striking a balance between backend and frontend development, I believe I can enhance my versatility as a developer. This not only aligns with industry demands for full-stack proficiency but also positions me to contribute meaningfully to a broader range of projects. Through this dual-focus approach, I aim to bridge the gap between client-side and server-side development, fostering a more holistic and well-rounded skill set that will serve me well in my future endeavors.

In essence, my goal for the upcoming trimester is to create a harmonious blend of frontend and backend expertise, ensuring a comprehensive skill set that enables me to tackle diverse and complex web development challenges with confidence and proficiency.
